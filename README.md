### Liner Regression Analysis 

Below is the result of multiple liner analysis,

The vehicle length and the ground clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values because their slope are not zero. Plusï¼Œthe absolute value of the t test for the vehicle length and the round clearance are very small. On the other hand, the slopes of vehicle weight, spoiler angle and AWD are very close to zero and provide a random amount of varience to the mpg values. The R-squared value indicates that the variable in this model predicts about 71.49% of the variance in the mpg values.

From the charts above we can see that the result for lot3 significantly deviated from the results of other lots. For example, the variance in lot1 and lot2 are relatively small while the variance in lot3 is greater than 100. Besides, the variance for the entire data set is less than 100. So, further investigation is needed for lot3.
